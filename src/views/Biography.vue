      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        I spent 12 years supporting both hardware and software for various radar technologies.
        During this time, I found a passion for software development. To further this passion,
        I went to school and earned my Bachelor's of Science from Western Governors University.
        Continuing my educational track, I am now working on getting my Master's of Science in software
        development
        from Boston University. I believe the combination of my experience supporting software and education
        allows
        me to see a unique side of the software development process. This makes me a strong asset to a
        software
        development
        team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am working as a full stack software developer using the technology stack of .Net, MS
        SQL
        Server,
        and Knockout JS. In my time as a developer, I have been able to work on several big features.
        One of which is to set up an event driven system to update third party APIs using Rabbit MQ and
        RESTful
        API.
        Another is adding content to a content management system that allows the deployment of custom
        websites
        using a
        guided layout. Other duties include participating in team Scrum events, working with Quality
        Assurance,
        and
        running software releases on a rotating schedule.
